#### Key ML Applications in Financial Modeling

**Stock Price Prediction and Trading**
ML models can **analyze historical data sets to make predictions about future stock performance** . This includes:
- **Algorithmic trading: Identifying patterns and developing trading strategies with speed and accuracy** 
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT): Identifying trading opportunities and executing trades at high speeds** 

**Risk Assessment and Management** 
ML algorithms **perform credit risk assessment with better precision and much faster than humans** . They can **identify risks based on historical data and probability statistics** , helping institutions make better lending decisions and manage portfolio risks.

**Fraud Detection and Compliance**
**Machine learning models learn from identifying patterns to understand normal behavior and make it easier to detect suspicious activities, like money laundering or insider trading** .

**Portfolio Optimization**
